# Opertions-in-OpenCV
How to perform Bitwise Operations on Images. This includes bitwise AND, OR, NOT and XOR operations. This code will take through on how to use Bitwise Operators (bitwise_and, bitwise_or, bitwise_xor, bitwise_not) in an image in OpenCV. Bitwise operations likebitwise_and(), bitwise_or(), bitwise_xor(), and bitwise_not() are useful when working with masks
